# Blind-Separation-of-Speech-Signals
Blind Source Separation of Speech Signals draws its motivation from the cocktail party problem where there are multiple sources which are communuicating with each other and we only need to focus on one particular source of interest. Blind source separation problem finds applications in a broad variety of fields like Speech Processing, image and even video to an extent in the form of activity recognition in Video. The work seen as a part of this repository is a part of my survey work for my theses on "Blind Source Separation of Speech" which implements the algorithm proposed by Prof.Wing-Kin Ma and Prof.Xiao Fu in their paper"A simple closed-form solution for overdetermined blind separation of locally sparse quasi-stationary sources."
